# FileNameFix

Simple bash script to rename all files in a project. Removes spaces and puts all characters to lower case.

## Usage

I recommend running it with bash :

```bash
bash file_rename.sh
```

But you can change permissions and run it as follows :

```bash
chmod +x files_rename.sh
./filename.sh
```
